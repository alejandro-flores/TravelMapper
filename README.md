## What is this?

Travel Mapper is a pet project I started last year to get more familiar with the [Google Maps iOS API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/). Maps are fun and the GMaps API has a ton of cool features to play with. With time I plan to keep adding features and extra functionality.

### Features

* Allows you to search and save a location you've visited on the map. Choose the travel category (Vacation, Work, Home, etc) tap on save and a marker with that Travel is dropped on the map.
* See all your saved Travels in the Travels UITableView, select a trip to view more details about the location such as current weather, time, travel type, etc.
* Uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the current weather for that location using its coordinates.
* Uses [api.geonames.org](api.geonames.org) to query the time data.
* Whent the current time at that location is past its sunset time, the theme of the page changes to dark, otherwise the standard theme is used during daylight.
* Change the map type, temperature units and more settings coming up from the settings page.
* ...more to come!
